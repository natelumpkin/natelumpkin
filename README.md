### Hi! I'm Nate!

I'm a full-stack software developer with training in Javascript, Python, React, and Redux. My most recent project and main focus right now is a clone of popular question-asking site Stack Overflow, where users can find trustworthy solutions to programming-related problems. I'm looking for opportunities to learn and continue developing my skills and learn new languages, libraries, and frameworks.

In my personal life, I'm a big fan of tabletop roleplaying -- I've led a continuous group of players for over a decade through a hand-crafted world with a custom ruleset based on Dungeons and Dragons. I'm a fiction writer -- I've completed a thesis collection of short stories in my time at UNC Chapel Hill, and a few self-produced zines in the time since. And I'm a powerlifter -- I train four times a week under an evidence-based training program.

Additional skills: HTML5 - CSS3 - Express - Flask - SQL - SQLAlchemy - Sequelize - Git - Version Control - OOP - Agile - SCRUM methodologies - Pair Programming - Team Collaboration - Strength-Based Communication

My creative and artistic side is hugely important to me. I love to craft unique experiences, whether it's coding project, D&D adventures, short-stories, or custom rulesets. I love learning, and am always looking for areas to develop or new skills to attain. In the past, I've applied myself to therapeutic counseling, Mandarin Chinese, and specialty coffee. I enjoy problem solving and puzzle games, and find coding to be a fresh and exciting challenge. I have an eye for clean and refreshing user interfaces, and get a lot of satisfaction out of creating aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experiences.

As a software developer, I've really enjoyed using Javascript, Python, React/Redux, Flask, CSS, and HTML. I'm currently practicing and reinforcing my full stack skills, particularly in Python, and in the future I'm interested in learning Ruby. Thanks for reading!
